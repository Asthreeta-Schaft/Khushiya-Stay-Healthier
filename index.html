            <p>A Step Towards Health</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Life loses interest, in case you are deprived of health. You enjoy neither food
            nor the world. Even spending time joyfully becomes a big problem. A healthy
            person lives more happy and peaceful life than any person having a diseased
            body. We can, therefore, say that the real wealth of a man is his health. In
            other words, to lead a healthy life, a person must be fit and fine both physically
            and mentally. For instance, if you are constantly eating junk food yet you do not
            have any disease, it does not make you healthy. You are not consuming healthy
            food which naturally means you are not healthy, just surviving. Therefore, to
            actually live and not merely survive, you need to have the basic essentials that
            make up for a healthy lifestyle.<br>
            
            Health is not merely the absence of disease and infirmity but a state of
            complete physical, social and mental well being. Health is thus a level of
            functional efficiency of living beings and the general condition of a person’s
            mind, body and spirit, meaning it is free illness, injury and pain. If you are
            strong and healthy you can be a shining example to others and teach them how
            to achieve vibrant health.<br>
            
            If you wish to acquire a healthy lifestyle, you will certainly have to make some
            changes in your life. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle demands consistent habits
            and disciplined life. There are various good habits that you can adopt like
            exercising regularly which will maintain your physical fitness. It also affects your
            mental health as when your appearance enhances, your confidence will
            automatically get boosted.<br>

<h3 style="color: grey;">What is Diabetes?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">How common is diabetes?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    As of 2015, 30.3 million people in the United States, or 9.4 percent of the population, had diabetes. More than 1 in 4 of them didn’t know they had the disease. Diabetes affects 1 in 4 people over the age of 65. About 90-95 percent of cases in adults are type 2 diabetes.   
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">Diabetes awareness</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    For some people diabetes awareness may be about the prevention of the onset of the condition. Healthy eating and more active lifestyles can ward off type 2 diabetes induced by being overweight. Learn to love food in a way that does not compromise your health, or your taste buds!.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">Talking about diabetes</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    By talking about diabetes and the effect is has on our lives, we help keep healthcare admistrators and politicians focused on the job of providing us with the care and information we need to successfully live with our diagnosis.

<h3 style="color: grey;">What is Human Brain?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. ... The cerebrum, the largest part of the human brain, consists of two cerebral hemispheres.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">Function of Brain</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">controls all functions of the body, interprets information from the outside world, and embodies the essence of the mind and soul. ... The brain controls our thoughts, memory and speech, movement of the arms and legs, and the function of many organs within our body.  
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">Why is it called the brain?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">An old etymologist, a student of German, derived Bregen (the German cognate of brain) from Brei “mush, paste; porridge.” The derivation is wrong, but the idea is sound. In the remote past, people had no notion what function the brain has in the human organism. They saw “mush” and called it accordingly.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">What are the 3 types of the brain?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">The brain can be divided into three basic units: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue called the cerebellum.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">What the human brain is made of?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">Brains are made of soft tissue, which includes gray and white matter, containing the nerve cells, non-neuronal cells (which help to maintain neurons and brain health), and small blood vessels. They have a high water content as well as a large amount (nearly 60 percent ) of fat.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">What is the physiology of the brain?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">The brain is an organ of nervous tissue that commands task-evoked responses, senses, movement, emotions, language, communication, thinking, and memory. ... The cerebral hemispheres have folds and convolutions on their surface. The ridges found between the convolutions are called gyri.
</p>

<h3 style="color: grey;">How many brains are in the human body?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">The human brain is actually two brains, each capable of advanced mental functions. When the cerebrum is divided surgically, it is as if the cranium contained two separate spheres of consciousness.
